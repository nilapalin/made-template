# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
BRFC - Behavior risk factors & cancer project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How do behavioral risks influence cancer (or even mutations). 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Cancer is one of the leading number of deaths, bronchus and lung cancer deaths are now ranked 6th among the leading causes of deaths (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death). Also obesity is a world wide health issue and influences diseases. Rising numbers in cancer and obesity are alerting and therefore it is of high interest to reveal any relations of obesity/behavioral risk factors and cancer in order to apply countermeasures.

This project aims to uncover relations of behavioral risk factors and cancer.

Evaluation:
- Differentiate race/ethnicity for cancer and BRFSS
- Differentiate gender for cancer and BRFSS
- Differentiate age for cancer and BRFSS
- search for data with specific genes regarding BRFSS
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226269/ MC4R and LEPR
    MC4R (melanocortin 4 receptor): https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/genes/ENSG00000166603
    https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin-4-Rezeptor 'Ferner unterdrückt er das Hungergefühl'

Problem:
Even though the GDC Datasource has a field for exposure weight or BMI, it is not filled in any of their datasets. Therefore, it is not possible to link the obesity numbers of BRFSS dataset to the cancer in general. For this report, a deeper evaluation is used and hence the following assumption is used:
- Genes MC4R and LEPR are involved in exposure of obesity
- Cancer with documented mutations in MC4R and LEPR could be associated to obesity
This are very weak assumptions and I would highly value if there would be a possibility in furture to either add obesity identifying data (like BMI) to cancer data or to make it possible to connect datasets (like in other studies e.g. NAKO (Nationale Gesundheitsstudie) which is not open data)

Also the GDC data is from different countries (united states, canada, ...). Since a lot of data sets are without any specification on that field (country of residence at enrollment), for reasons of ease for that project this is ignored. (TODO: check)

Changes in genes can be harmful but can also be without or with low consequences. Therefore a further view could be to evaluate the impact of the DNA changes.

All the evaluation is not complete since it is on data which potentially be incomplete since the projects are not forced to deliver. In Germany there is a law for delivering cancer related data, however, it only contains a very limited subset of information which GDC is providing.


Hypothesis:
If we can see changes in the values of obesity in every year, this will be somehow reflected in the cancer numbers (esp. with the MC4R and LEPR mutations).
1. show changing data in obesity within brfss data of the last 10 or so years
    LocationDesc == National
    Class == Obesity / Weight Status
    Total == Total

    LocationDesc == National
    Class == Obesity / Weight Status
    Gender == Male or Female

    LocationDesc == National
    Class == Obesity / Weight Status
    Age(years) == 25 - 34 or 35 - 44 or 45 - 54 or 55 - 64 or 65 or older

   
2. show data of cancer cases with and without mutations from gdc over the last 10 or so years (MC4R mutations only relevant 2010-2018)    
3. bring 1. and 2. together and show possible correlations
